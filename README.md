I designed and implemented a cloud-based cybersecurity lab in Microsoft Azure, leveraging Microsoft Sentinel for advanced threat detection and analysis. This lab is structured to simulate real-world cybersecurity scenarios, enhancing my Security Operations Center (SOC) skills, threat intelligence capabilities, and automation expertise.

Key Features of the Lab:
Virtual Machines (VMs): Deployed to simulate enterprise environments, hosting both Windows and Linux systems to monitor various attack surfaces.
Security Event Logging: Configured Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud to collect and analyze security logs across systems.
Kusto Query Language (KQL): Used for advanced log queries, data correlation, and threat hunting within Microsoft Sentinel.
GeoIP Mapping: Integrated IP geolocation tracking to visualize and investigate potential attack sources globally.
Threat Simulation & Detection: Simulated brute-force attacks, phishing attempts, and anomalous user behavior to test SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) capabilities.
Automation & Incident Response: Implemented Playbooks and Automated Responses using Azure Logic Apps to reduce response time and enhance security efficiency.
This project has strengthened my ability to detect, investigate, and mitigate cyber threats using Microsoft Sentinel and Azure-native security tools. Additionally, it has provided hands-on experience in log analysis, threat intelligence, and security automation, preparing me for roles in SOC analysis, security engineering, and cloud security operations.
