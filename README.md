Cloud-Based Cybersecurity Lab Using Microsoft Azure & Sentinel
Overview
I designed and implemented a cloud-based cybersecurity lab in Microsoft Azure, utilizing Microsoft Sentinel for advanced threat detection, analysis, and automated incident response. This lab simulates real-world Security Operations Center (SOC) scenarios, enhancing my expertise in threat intelligence, security automation, and log analysis.

Key Features & Technologies
Virtual Machines (VMs) – Deployed both Windows and Linux instances to simulate enterprise attack surfaces and security monitoring.
Security Event Logging – Configured Azure Monitor, Log Analytics, and Microsoft Defender for Cloud to centralize security event collection and analysis.
Kusto Query Language (KQL) – Used for advanced log correlation, threat hunting, and anomaly detection within Microsoft Sentinel.
GeoIP Mapping – Integrated IP geolocation tracking to visualize and investigate potential attack origins globally.
Threat Simulation & Detection – Simulated brute-force attacks, phishing attempts, and anomalous user behavior to evaluate SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) and SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) capabilities.
Automation & Incident Response – Developed Azure Logic Apps Playbooks to automate threat response, reduce incident resolution time, and enhance security posture.
Key Learning Outcomes
✔ Strengthened ability to detect, investigate, and mitigate cyber threats using Microsoft Sentinel & Azure-native security tools.
✔ Gained hands-on experience in log analysis, threat intelligence, and security automation.
✔ Developed skills relevant to SOC analysis, security engineering, and cloud security operations.

This project demonstrates my ability to implement cloud-based security monitoring, leverage SIEM/SOAR tools, and apply real-world cybersecurity defense strategies—all essential for modern SOC and cloud security roles.
